## What We Will Cover in This Session

<br>

-   Why this is important/useful
-   Readable code
-   Naming things
-   Organising your projects
-   Version control

<br> Disclaimer - some of it is quite specific to coding in R

## Why This is Important

<br> Good coding practices are important because it helps ensure that your code is:

-   readable - is the code written in a clear and readable way?

-   understandable - is the code easy to follow? Is it clear what is being done at each stage?

-   reproducible - could another person be able to re-run the code?

## Why This is Important

<br> This is useful for working on any type of coding project. <br> For solo projects, you may think your code makes perfect sense when you are writing it, but when you look back it does not... <br> For working with others it is important it not only makes sense to you but to your collaborators

## Why This is Important

<br> Introducing some of these practices into your workflow at the start of projects can help them run more smoothly, avoid potential confusion and save time further down the line.

<br> There is a move for science to become more reproducible, with more researchers making their code and data available when publishing a paper. <br> This means your code may be viewed by a wider range of people and, therefore, even more important the code is reproducible.

## Readable Code

<br> There are a few things you can do to make your code easier to read <br> <br> youshouldavoidwritingcodelikethisasitisdifficulttoreadthesentence

## Readable Code

thisisabadnameforafunction \<- function()

<br> Do not use spaces in names

this is also a bad name for a function \<- function()

## Readable Code

For naming variables and functions there are two common conventions you can use:

-   camelCase e.g. thisIsABetterNameForAFunction \<- function()

-   snake_case e.g. this_is_an_even_better_name_for_a\_function \<- function()

<br> Personal preference but be consistent

## Readable Code

<br> The `janitor` package in R has useful functions for cleaning variable names

```{r}
#| echo: false
data <- read_csv(here::here("data", "trust_los.csv"))
head(data)
```

## Readable Code

<br> The `janitor` package in R has useful functions for cleaning variable names

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

data <- clean_names(data)

head(data, n = 4)
```

<br> Default is to use snake_case

## Readable Code

<br> The `janitor` package in R has useful functions for cleaning variable names <br>

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
data <- clean_names(data, case = "upper_camel")

head(data, n = 4)
```

<br> But you can specify to use CamelCase if you prefer

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
data <- clean_names(data)
```

## Readable Code

<br> Use spaces in lines of code to separate names,functions & operators <br> <br>

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
# bad

data$patient_age_grp<-if_else(data$patient_age<55,0,1)

trust1<-data[data$organisation_name=="Trust1",]

# better

data$patient_age_grp <- if_else(data$patient_age <= 55, 0, 1)

trust1 <- data[data$organisation_name == "Trust1", ]
```

## Readable Code

<br> Note the exception for between a function name and opening of brackets

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

# like this 
data$patient_age_grp <- if_else(data$patient_age <= 55, 0, 1)

# not like this

data$patient_age_grp <- if_else (data$patient_age <= 55, 0, 1)

```

## Readable Code

<br> Avoid lines that are too long <br>

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| output: FALSE

# bad

ggplot(data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = patient_age, y = length_of_stay, colour = as.factor(death_flag))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Age and length of stay of patients at 10 hospital trusts", x = "Patient Age (years)", y = "Patient Length of Stay (Days)")

# better

ggplot(data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = patient_age, 
                 y = length_of_stay, 
                 colour = as.factor(death_flag))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Age and length of stay of patients at 10 hospital trusts", 
       x = "Patient Age (years)", 
       y = "Patient Length of Stay (Days)")
```

## Readable Code

<br> If using the `tidyverse` or `ggplot2` then start a new line after each `%>%` or `+`

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| output: FALSE

data %>%
  filter(organisation_name == "Trust1") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = patient_age, 
             y = length_of_stay, 
             colour = as.factor(death_flag))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Readable Code

<br> Use functions to avoid repeating lines of code <br> General rule of thumb is that if you copy and paste a section of code more than two times then you should make a function

<br> [Chapter 25](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions) of the R4DS book is a useful place to start

## Readable Code

<br> Example of a simple function

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

function_example <- function(x, y) {
  (x + y) / 2
}

function_example(7, 15)

```

## Readable Code

<br> Slightly more complex example

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
mean_function <- function(org_name, var) {
  
  data %>%
    filter(organisation_name == org_name) %>%
    summarise(mean_var = mean(var))
  
} 

mean_function("Trust1", data$patient_age)

```

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

mean_function("Trust2", data$length_of_stay)

```

## Readable Code

<br> You can use the `purrr` package to apply a function to multiple items in a list <br> Or in base R the `lapply`, `sapply`, `vapply` functions do similar

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| output: FALSE

plot_function <- function(org_name) {
  
  age_los_plot <- data %>%
  filter(organisation_name == org_name) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = patient_age, 
             y = length_of_stay, 
             colour = as.factor(death_flag))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Patient Age (Years)",
       y = "Length of Stay (Days)")
  
  age_los_plot

}

orgs_list <- list("Trust1", "Trust2", "Trust3")

purrr::map(orgs_list, plot_function)

```

## Readable Code

::: panel-tabset
## Trust 1

```{r}

#| fig-height: 0.5

plot_function("Trust1")

```

## Trust 2

```{r}

#| fig-height: 0.5

plot_function("Trust2")

```

## Trust 3

```{r}

#| fig-height: 0.5

plot_function("Trust3")

```

## Readable Code

Use comments to annotate your code so it is easier to follow. <br> Particularly for documenting WHY you have done something <br> <br>

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

# Anything preceded by a # will not be executed by R

# 10*15

10*20

```

## Readable Code

Use comments to annotate your code so it is easier to follow. <br> Particularly for documenting WHY you have done something <br> <br>

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

# At the start of an R script I usually write a few lines describing what the script is for, 
# what the input data is and what the expected outputs are. 
# Then use comments throughout to break up the code and explain the analysis. Example:

# 15 patients in dataset with their age missing, excluding them from analysis

data <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(patient_age))

# n = 285 from here

```

## Naming Things

<br> When you are naming new variables choose names that are descriptive. <br> Do not duplicate names <br>

```{r}
#| echo: true

# bad

data %>%
  group_by(organisation_name) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(death_flag),
            mean_1 = mean(patient_age),
            mean_2 = mean(length_of_stay)) %>%
  head(n = 4)

```

## Naming Things

<br> When you are naming new variables or functions choose names that are descriptive. <br> Do not duplicate names <br>

```{r}
#| echo: true

# better

data %>%
  group_by(organisation_name) %>%
  summarise(n_deaths = sum(death_flag),
            mean_patient_age = mean(patient_age),
            mean_length_of_stay = mean(length_of_stay)) %>%
  head(n = 4)

```

## Naming Things

<br> When you are naming new variables or functions choose names that are descriptive. <br> Do not duplicate names <br>

```{r}
#| echo: true

# bad

model_a <- glm(data$patient_age ~ data$length_of_stay, family = gaussian())

model_b <- glm(as.factor(data$death_flag) ~ data$patient_age, family = binomial())

# better

model_los_age <- glm(data$length_of_stay ~ data$patient_age, 
                     family = gaussian())

model_death_age <- glm(as.factor(data$death_flag) ~ data$patient_age, 
                       family = binomial())

```

## Naming Things

<br> For naming files again use descriptive names. If working on a larger project then consider having a separate file for each stage of the project, and make it clear what order the analysis has been done in. <br>

For example: <br> `01_data_cleaning.R` <br> `02_baseline_characteristics.R` <br> `03_descriptive_stats.R` <br> `04_models.R` <br> `05_figures.R` <br>

## Organising Your Work

<br> Within an R script you can use sections to organise your scripts. <br>

<br>
Insert a new section using ctrl + shift + R and navigate using the document outline on the right of the script

## Organising Your Work

![](screenshots/sections_example.png)

## Organising Your Work

<br> Working within an R Project is a good way to organise not only your R scripts but keeps all the data and outputs from your work in the same place. <br><br> Avoids the need to use `set_wd()` at the start of your scripts, which is not best practice, particularly when collaborating with others.

## Organising Your Work

<br> `set_wd()` uses absolute file paths, e.g.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
setwd("C:/Users/mfbx9sbk/OneDrive - The University of Manchester/MSc Teaching/coding_best_practice_2")
```

<br> This can cause problems when you are collaborating with others, as not everyone will have their files organised in the same way.

## Organising Your Work

<br> R Projects use relative file paths, which are relative to the working directory of the project.<br> <br> For example, you want to save a cleaned version of your data, or a plot you have generated.

## Organising Your Work

<br> Here the file paths are relative to the Project directory <br><br>

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
ggplot(data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = patient_age, y = length_of_stay))
ggsave("figs/age_los_scatter.png")


write_csv(data, "data/trust_los_clean.csv")
```

<br> So if you shared the project with another person then it would not matter where they saved the project, all the file paths would work.

## Organising Your Work

<br> Use the README.MD document to briefly describe your project, including what you have done and what the output is.

<br> ![](screenshots/readme_example.PNG)

## Organising Your Work

<br> Use the source() function to call and run other R scripts within your current script.
<br>
<br> For example, you may want to automatically run your data cleaning script before your analysis script

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| output: FALSE
source("scripts/01_data_cleaning.R")
```

## Organising Your Work
<br>
<br> Or, you may have a separate script with functions you want to use 

<br>
```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| output: FALSE
source("scripts/00_functions.R")
```


## Organising Your Work

<br> This can be useful for building Reproducible Analytical Pipelines, where analysis can be run repeatedly and reproducibly. 


## Version Control

<br> If you have ever had a bunch of files that look something like this then you may want to consider using a version control system to manage your projects

![](screenshots/files.png)

## Version Control

<br> Using a version control system can:

-   help organise your work and keep track of updates and changes
-   make it easier to collaborate with others
-   create a repository that can be shared more widely when a project is complete
-   be difficult to navigate at first but quickly become integrated into your regular workflow

## Version Control

<br> The most widely used (in the data science community) software for version control is Git. <br> Git takes snapshots of all files in a project at a specific time - referred to as a "commit". <br> It stores the initial version and any subsequent updated versions that are committed. <br> It tracks any changes you have made at each commit, which can be identified using the "diff" command

## Version Control

<br> GitHub is a complementary hosting platform for your repositories (others are available). <br> Once updates have been committed to Git they can be "pushed" to GitHub. <br> Collaborators can then "fork" a copy of the repository and work on it locally whilst you are also still working on it, by pushing and pulling commits to GitHub.

## Version Control

<br> What a repository looks like on GitHub ![](screenshots/github_example.PNG)

## Version Control

<br> I would recommend reading this [article](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/) which explains in more detail about how to use Git and GitHub. ![](screenshots/git_bryan.PNG)

## Version Control

<br> Git can be integrated into RStudio and therefore more easily be incorporated into your workflow. <br> Once installed an additional tab in the environment pane will appear, where you can commit and push files.

![](screenshots/git_rstudio.PNG)

## Version Control

<br> Or you can go into the RStudio terminal tab and type Git commands from there

![](screenshots/git_terminal.PNG)

## Version Control

<br> To install Git and connect it to your GitHub and RStudio then follow this [tutorial](https://happygitwithr.com) by Jenny Bryan. It talks through each setup step and how to do basic Git commands.
