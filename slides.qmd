## What we will cover in this session

<br>

-   Why this is important/useful
-   Readable code
-   Naming things
-   Organising your projects
-   Version control

## Why this is important

<br>It is important that your code is:

-   readable

-   understandable

-   reproducible

Particularly if you are collaborating with others but even if you are working on a project by yourself

## Resources

## Readable code

<br> For naming variables and functions there are two common conventions you can use:

-   theFirstOneIsCalledCamelCase

-   the_second_is_called_snake_case

<br> Personal preference but be consistent <br> Do not use spaces in names

## Readable Code

<br> The `janitor` package in R has useful functions for cleaning variable names

```{r}
#| echo: false
data <- read_csv(here::here("data", "trust_los.csv"))
head(data)
```

## Readable Code

<br> The `janitor` package in R has useful functions for cleaning variable names

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

data <- clean_names(data)

head(data, n = 4)
```

## Readable Code

<br> The `janitor` package in R has useful functions for cleaning variable names <br>

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
data <- clean_names(data, case = "upper_camel")

head(data, n = 4)
```

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
data <- clean_names(data)
```

## Readable Code

<br> Use spaces in lines of code <br>

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
# bad

data$patient_age_grp<-if_else(data$patient_age<55,0,1)

trust1<-data[data$organisation_name=="Trust1",]

# better

data$patient_age_grp <- if_else(data$patient_age <= 55, 0, 1)

trust1 <- data[data$organisation_name == "Trust1", ]
```

## Readable Code

<br> Avoid lines that are too long <br>

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| output: FALSE

# bad

ggplot(data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = patient_age, y = length_of_stay, colour = as.factor(death_flag))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Age and length of stay of patients at 10 hospital trusts", x = "Patient Age (years)", y = "Patient Length of Stay (Days)")

# better

ggplot(data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = patient_age, 
                 y = length_of_stay, 
                 colour = as.factor(death_flag))) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Age and length of stay of patients at 10 hospital trusts", 
       x = "Patient Age (years)", 
       y = "Patient Length of Stay (Days)")
```

## Readable Code

<br> If using the `tidyverse` or `ggplot2` then start a new line after each `%>%` or `+`

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| output: FALSE

data %>%
  filter(organisation_name == "Trust1") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = patient_age, 
             y = length_of_stay, 
             colour = as.factor(death_flag))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Readable Code

<br> Use functions to avoid repeating lines of code

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| output: FALSE

plot_function <- function(org_name) {
  
  age_los_plot <- data %>%
  filter(organisation_name == org_name) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = patient_age, 
             y = length_of_stay, 
             colour = as.factor(death_flag))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Patient Age (Years)",
       y = "Length of Stay (Days)")
  
  age_los_plot

}

orgs_list <- list("Trust1", "Trust2", "Trust3")

purrr::map(orgs_list, plot_function)

```

## Readable Code

::: panel-tabset
## Trust 1

```{r}

#| fig-height: 0.5

plot_function("Trust1")

```

## Trust 2

```{r}

#| fig-height: 0.5

plot_function("Trust2")

```

## Trust 3

```{r}

#| fig-height: 0.5

plot_function("Trust3")

```

## Readable Code

Use comments to annotate your code so it is easier to follow. <br> Particularly for documenting WHY you have done something <br>

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Anything preceded by a # will not be executed by R

# 10*15

10*20

```

## Naming Things

<br> When you are naming new variables choose names that are descriptive. <br> Do not duplicate names <br>

```{r}
#| echo: true

# bad

data %>%
  group_by(organisation_name) %>%
  summarise(n = sum(death_flag),
            mean_1 = mean(patient_age),
            mean_2 = mean(length_of_stay)) %>%
  head(n = 4)

```

## Naming Things

<br> When you are naming new variables or functions choose names that are descriptive. <br> Do not duplicate names <br>

```{r}
#| echo: true

# better

data %>%
  group_by(organisation_name) %>%
  summarise(n_deaths = sum(death_flag),
            mean_patient_age = mean(patient_age),
            mean_length_of_stay = mean(length_of_stay)) %>%
  head(n = 4)

```

## Naming Things

<br> When you are naming new variables or functions choose names that are descriptive. <br> Do not duplicate names <br>

```{r}
#| echo: true

# bad

model_a <- glm(data$patient_age ~ data$length_of_stay, family = gaussian())

model_b <- glm(as.factor(data$death_flag) ~ data$patient_age, family = binomial())

# better

model_los_age <- glm(data$length_of_stay ~ data$patient_age, 
                     family = gaussian())

model_death_age <- glm(as.factor(data$death_flag) ~ data$patient_age, 
                       family = binomial())

```

## Naming Things

<br> For naming files again use descriptive names. If working on a larger project then consider having a separate file for each stage of the project, and make it clear what order the analysis has been done in. <br>

For example: <br> `01_data_cleaning.R` <br> `02_baseline_characteristics.R` <br> `03_descriptive_stats.R` <br> `04_models.R` <br> `05_figures.R` <br>

## Organising Your Work

<br> Within an R script you can use sections to organise your scripts. <br>

Insert a new section using ctrl + shift + R and navigate using the document outline on the right of the script

## Organising Your Work

![](screenshots/sections_example.png)

## Organising Your Work

<br> Working within an R Project is a good way to organise not only your R scripts but keeps all the data and outputs from your work in the same place. <br><br> Avoids the need to use `set_wd()` at the start of your scripts, which is not best practice, particularly when collaborating with others.

## Organising Your Work

<br> `set_wd()` uses absolute file paths, e.g.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
setwd("C:/Users/mfbx9sbk/OneDrive - The University of Manchester/MSc Teaching/coding_best_practice_2")
```

<br> This can cause problems when you are collaborating with others, as not everyone will have their files organised in the same way.

## Organising Your Work

<br> R Projects use relative file paths, which are relative to the working directory of the project.<br> <br> For example, you want to save a cleaned version of your data, or a plot you have generated.

## Organising Your Work

<br> Here the file paths are relative to the Project directory <br><br>

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
ggplot(data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = patient_age, y = length_of_stay))
ggsave("figs/age_los_scatter.png")


write_csv(data, "data/trust_los_clean.csv")
```

<br> So if you shared the project with another person then it would not matter where they saved the project, all the file paths would work.
